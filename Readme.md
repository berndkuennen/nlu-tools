# natural language understanding
## A small collection of nlu tools
Recently I built a small PoC for language detection and decided to publish it. And because it's just a
small PoC which may be followed by others in short time, I've put it into some kind of "umbrella project"
to avoid too many git repos with just a couple of bytes.

## language-detection
This is s small project based on a python wsgi app and a dockerfile which together create a microservice
to detect the language of some lines of given text.
